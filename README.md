# Serverless REST API with Angular, Persistence, and Security
## using Angular, MongoDB, Github Pages, Auth0 and Webtask

This is a quick demo of a serverless full stack app with static file hosting, a secure REST API, and a robust persistence layer.
Hereâ€™s how  all the moving parts are managed:
- Identity management and security supported by Auth0 and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Serverless REST API provided by an Express app with Webtask
- Persistence layer with a MongoDB database hosted by mLab
